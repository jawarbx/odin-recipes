		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p class="content">A Japanese noodle soup that consists of Chinese style wheat noodles served in a meat broth. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen. Here is one of them.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul class="content">
			<li>1 (8 ounce) beef sirloin steak</li>
			<li>Â½ cup gluten-free soy sauce (tamari)</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
			<li>4 cups beef broth</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons miso paste</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon seasame oil</li>
			<li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles</li>
			<li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol class="content">
			<li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
			<li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
			<li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
			<li>While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
			<li>Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top.</li>
		</ol>
